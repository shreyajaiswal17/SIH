## Problem Statement 

### SIH - 1641

> _Create an Annual Report Portal for institute where all the departmental reports can be integrated and customized._

</div>






<h2 align="center">üìÑ Description </h2>

Educational institutes generate large volumes of data annually‚Äîacademic results, research publications, finances, achievements, and more. Manually compiling this into a structured, insightful annual report is time-consuming and prone to errors. The goal is to develop a robust and user-friendly portal that automates data collection, organization, analysis, and visualization across departments, enabling the creation of dynamic, accurate reports with minimal manual effort.

The portal should feature secure role-based user authentication, integration with external tools (e.g., student/finance systems), real-time analytics, customizable dashboards, and automated report generation (PDF, HTML, etc.). It should support collaboration, feedback collection, version control, and multimedia-rich content. A clean, responsive UI, multilingual support, and adherence to data privacy standards (GDPR, FERPA) are essential. The end solution must be scalable, adaptable to various institutes, and capable of processing large datasets efficiently.

<h2 align="center">üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture</h2>

- Users authenticate via **Express.js** and **JWT**, with **role-based access control** managing visibility.
- User credentials and metadata are securely stored in **MongoDB**, with encryption for all sensitive data.
- Uploaded files (e.g., exported from TallyERP or Academia) are stored in an **AWS S3 Bucket**.
- Unstructured uploaded data is processed by an **Ollama AI model** to convert it into structured **JSON**.
- The structured data is stored back into **MongoDB**, also encrypted for security.
- For analytics, structured data is sent again to **Ollama AI**, which prepares it for **Chart.js** visualizations.
- **Chart.js** renders interactive graphs and charts on the frontend, enabling drill-downs and detailed exploration.
- The platform ensures full data security, scalability, and AI-driven automation in both data processing and reporting.
